[Genesis Block]: The genesis block is the first block in any blockchain-based protocol.
It is the foundation on which additional blocks are sequentially added 
to form a chain of blocks, resulting in the term, blockchain being coined.
The genesis block is also referred to as block zero

[Blockchain]: blockchain is a decentralized, distributed, and oftentimes public, 
digital ledger that is used to record transactions across many computers 
so that any involved record cannot be altered retroactively, without the
alteration of all subsequent blocks.This allows the participants to verify 
and audit transactions independently and relatively inexpensively 
[OR]
blockchainis a growing list of records, called blocks, that are linked using cryptography.
Each block contains a cryptographic hash of the previous block,a timestamp, and transaction 
data (generally represented as a Merkle tree).

[Mining]: Mining is a process to validate the transactions by solving difficult mathematical puzzle called 
[OR]
Mining is the process of putting in real-world work (in the form of electricity) to create a valid block that
will be accepted by the rest of the network.

Mining =(Previous Block Hash + Merkle Root + Timestamp + Difficulty Bits + Nonce )
